# Budget-Tracker

Hello , my name is Blamah Kotay. Welcomee to the BK Budget Tracker.

This tracker was made through HTML, SASS styling and javaScript. This tracker increased my understanding of SASS and OOP (Object Oriented Programming) through the use of variables, mixins, objects, properties and first class function.

The use of SASS was made useful and more efficient to style the tracker throug thee use of making variables and nesting to have more order and quicker code to display. The use of the class and DOM manipulation was made useful to seperate the expenses and incomes of the tracker and to directly impact the display of the desired budget outcome.
